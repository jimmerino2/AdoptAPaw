# 🐱 AdoptAPaw - Pet Adoption Website
AdoptAPaw is Final Year Project I developed before graduating my Diploma in Information Technology (DIIT) in Sunway College @ Velocity.

The website allows users to both adopt pets in need online, as well as allow foster parents or shelters to put up adoption listings on a centralized platform.

Update: The project is currently disabled as my Supabase trial expired 😅

## ⚠️ Problem Statement 
1. Stray animals are seen much more frequent over the years in Malaysia, causing social distress and health concerns
2. The lack of information and education regarding pet ownership and caregiving results in many owners giving up their pets and leaving them outside to fend for themselves
3. Malaysian pet adoption websites are fragmented and messy, ruining the user experience and demotivating them from using quick, online gateways to adopt a pet in need
4. Foster parents or new shelters have minimal reach to a large audience, reducing the chances of their pets to receive adoption opportunities

## ✅ Project Objectives
1. Build a website to facilitate and streamline the adoption process for pets in Malaysia
2. Provide infromation and educate users on the challenges on adopting and taking care of pets to raise awareness and nourish responsibility
3. Create a centralized website for users across the country to view listings from multiple individuals or shelters, reducing complexity
4. Allow shelters and caregivers an equal opportunity in helping their fosters find their forever home

## ⭐ Features and Functionality
### Users
1. Authenticate and create accounts with email verification
2. View pet listings, registered shelters and foster parents, as well as FAQ about pet adoption
3. View pet details and schedule appointments to visit the pet

### Shelters and Foster Parents
1. Create and manage listings for pets to be put up for adoption
2. Approve or reject appointment requests made by users for listed pets
